# Vestigo: Google Summer of Code 2026 Project Ideas

# Automated Peripheral Modeling

## Summary

Extend **Vestigo's** emulation capabilities to automatically detect and handle missing hardware peripherals (NVRAM, GPIO, Watchdogs) that typically cause IoT firmware to crash during dynamic analysis.

This project focuses on increasing the "Success Rate" of emulation. The work includes building a "Peripheral Stubber" that intercepts invalid memory accesses in Qiling and provides mock data to keep the firmware running.

# Cross-Modal Dynamic Instrumentation (Static-to-Dynamic Bridge)

## Summary

Create a unified bridge that translates **Static Analysis findings** (from Ghidra) into **Dynamic Instrumentation scripts** (for Frida/Qiling) to automatically verify cryptographic functions.

This project focuses on closing the loop between "Guessing" and "Proving." The work involves writing a generator that takes Ghidra's predicted function addresses (e.g., "Potential AES at 0x4000") and auto-generates Frida hooks to intercept those specific addresses. It also includes developing a **Real-Time Entropy Monitor** that scans memory buffers during execution to distinguish between high-entropy ciphertext and low-entropy keys/plaintext.

# Differential Trace Analysis & Taint Tracking

## Summary

Implement a **Differential Analysis Engine** that compares execution traces of the same binary under different inputs to isolate cryptographic processing logic.

This project focuses on "Behavioral Identification." The work includes building a tracer (on top of Qiling) that records memory access patterns and instruction sequences. By running the binary twice with slightly different inputs (e.g., changing 1 bit), the student will implement algorithms to detect the "Avalanche Effect" in the execution trace, effectively pinpointing the exact basic blocks responsible for encryption/hashing without needing symbol names.
